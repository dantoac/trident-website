# Frequently Asked Questions
## Q: Why did you pick the name "Project Trident"?
A:  We were looking for a name that was unique, yet would still relate to the BSD community. Since Beastie (the FreeBSD mascot) is always pictured with a trident, it felt like that would be a great name.

## Q: Do we need to be at a certain TrueOS install level/release to upgrade?
A: As long as you have a TrueOS system which has been updated to at least the 18.03 release you should be automatically upgraded to the new organization framework without issue.

**Q: Who is working on the new Desktop Project?**
A: The Desktop project is being led by prior members of the TrueOS team. Ken, JT, Tim, and Rod will be the initial people behind the project.  However as Project Trident is a community project first, we look forward to those who want to join the team.  TrueOS was/is a iXsystems project.  By being a community project, Trident will have the freedom to follow their own goals and destiny


**Q: Where will users go for technical support?**
A: 

**Q: How will the project be supported now?**
A: Project Trident will be sponsored by the community.  However, that community already has its first member.  To show their support, iXsystems, is the first community sponsor of the project.  

**Q: How can I help support the project financially?**
A: Several methods will exist, from one time donations via Paypal, monthly support via Patreon, Cryptocurrency donations, to limited time swag t-shirt campaigns during the year.  We are also looking into more alternative methods of support like using LibrePay ( https://liberapay.com/ ), and if BountySource ( https://www.bountysource.com/ ) will ever fix their github integration we will use that as well. 

**Q: Will there be any transparency of the financial donations and expenditures?**
A: Yes, we will be totally open with how much money comes into the project and what it is spent on.  Due to concerns of privacy, we will not identify individuals and their donations amounts unless they specifically request to be identified.  We will release a monthly overview in/out ledger, so that community members can see where their money is going.  

**Q: How can I help support the project in other ways?**
A: We are always looking for developers who want to join the project.  If youâ€™re not a developer you can still help, as a community project we will be more reliant on contributions from the community in the form of how-to guides and other user centric
